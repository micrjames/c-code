## General Info
The code, here, is written in the course of working through *The C Programming Language* (K&R) book.

## Technologies Used 
As the code is written based on the material contain in the K&R book referenced above, the programming language used is *C*.

Furthermore, a makefile for use in basic code can be found in the *makefile_template* directory.

## Contents
### ncurses
#### Hello, World
A basic example which gets a minimalistic window created displaying the text 'Hello World'.
#### Get Text
A less basic example than the 'Hello, World' example where we can input and then output a character or characters.
### Hello World Examples
### Greeting
### Temperature

## Setup
Simply change from the main directory of *c-code* to the directory that contains the relevant code. And, *copy* the makefile template files to your project. Within *outfile*, fill in the *target* file and the *util_funcs* as a list. An example of setting up the *outfile* can be found in the other project directories.

## Usage
The code in each directory can be compiled, linked and executed by invoking the relevant *makefile* command.

Compile and link the files specified in the makefile files.
```
    make
```
Run the project.
```
    make run
```
Clean the compiled project file and object files.
```
    make clean
```

## Project Status
The project will be in an ongoing status until the code for each section is completed and the K&R book has been completed as well.

## Room for Improvement
Similarly to the above section of this document, there can be seen a general room for improvement as the greater project associated with the *c-code* project is a learning project.
